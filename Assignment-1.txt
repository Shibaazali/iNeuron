1. Store raw data into hdfs location ?
   a. Copied the data from my local to the hadoop/VM location (/tmp/data/sales_order_data.csv) using FileZila.
   b. Copying raw data into hdfs location 
      > hadoop fs -put /tmp/data/sales_order_data.csv /tmp/hive_class
   
   
2. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store
csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while
creating table ?

   create table sales_order_csv
    > (ORDERNUMBER int,QUANTITYORDERED int,PRICEEACH
      float,ORDERLINENUMBER int,SALES float,STATUS string,MONTH_ID
      int,YEAR_ID int,PRODUCTLINE string,MSRP int,PRODUCTCODE string,PHONE
      string,CITY string,STATE string,POSTALCODE string,COUNTRY
      string,TERRITORY string,CONTACTLASTNAME string,CONTACTFIRSTNAME
      string,DEALSIZE string)
    > row format delimited
    > fields terminated by ','
    > tblproperties("skip.header.line.count"="1");


3. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv" ?
   load data  inpath '/tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_csv;

4. Create an internal hive table which will store data in ORC format
"sales_order_orc" ?

   create table sales_order_orc
    > (ORDERNUMBER int,QUANTITYORDERED int,PRICEEACH
      float,ORDERLINENUMBER int,SALES float,STATUS string,MONTH_ID
      int,YEAR_ID int,PRODUCTLINE string,MSRP int,PRODUCTCODE string,PHONE
      string,CITY string,STATE string,POSTALCODE string,COUNTRY
      string,TERRITORY string,CONTACTLASTNAME string,CONTACTFIRSTNAME
      string,DEALSIZE string)
    > stored as orc;

5. Load data from "sales_order_csv" into "sales_order_orc"

   a. load data local inpath 'file:///tmp/hive_class/sales_order_data.csv' into table sales_order_orc;
                                          (  or  )
   b. create table sales_order_orc stored as orc as select * from sales_order_csv;




6.Perform below menioned queries on "sales_order_orc" table :

        a. Calculatye total sales per year ?
            Select SUM(SALES)/12 as Total_sales_py, YEAR_ID
            from sales_order_orc
            GROUP BY YEAR_ID
            ORDER BY Total_sales_py DESC;
        
        b. Find a product for which maximum orders were placed ?
            Select Productline, MAX(Quantityordered) as Max_Orders
            from sales_order_orc
            GROUP BY Productline
            ORDER BY Max_orders DESC;
            
        c. Calculate the total sales for each quarter ?
            
            
        d. In which quarter sales was minimum
        e. In which country sales was maximum and in which country sales was minimum
            select max(SALES) as MAX_SALES, COUNTRY 
            from sales_order_orc
            GROUP BY COUNTRY
            ORDER BY MAX_SALES DESC;
            
        f. Calculate quartelry sales for each city
            select min(SALES) as MIN_SALES, COUNTRY 
            from sales_order_orc
            GROUP BY COUNTRY
            ORDER BY MIN_SALES;
            
        h. Find a month for each year in which maximum number of quantities were sold
